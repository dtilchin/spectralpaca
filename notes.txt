SpectrAlpaca - don't let them steal your color


Fight your way through each stage to the grey place where you need to create a rainbow. Once you do that, color is restored, and you can move on. Creatures try to steal your saturation, don't let them! 




# goal
create the rainbow, brining color to the land.
go to the rainbow area, which is grey, and stay there for a while while the rainbow builds (maybe it takes color from you to build, but then you gain it back?)

enemies try to steal your color (health). when they take your color, they get a bit colorful. if you kill them, they drop the color and you can get it back.

enemies are in your way, on the way to the rainbow.









TODO

- put on github
- make goal obvious
- crosshair
- walking animation
- "meaningful gameplay"
- weapon types
- enemy types
- dank map
- dank effects
- objects/map in front of player are transparent
- ideas for different goal types (rip off Helldivers, probably)


FX ideas

- Player trail particles that leave splashes of color on the ground
- Desaturation around areas
- "cathedral" light ray effects (wide ones, maybe color changing?)
- "snow" of colors
- per-voxel effects, such as shimmering, or fading in/out across the volume



public class SetVolumeAlpha : MonoBehaviour {

    public int alpha = 0;

    //Sets the alpha on all voxels in the volume this script is placed on.
	public void SetAlpha () {
        var frame = GetComponent<Volume>().Frames[0];
        for (int i = 0; i < frame.Voxels.Length; i++)
        {
            var c = frame.Voxels[i].Color;  // get the current voxel colour
            c.a = (byte)alpha ;  // set the alpha
            frame.Voxels[i].Color = c;  // set the colour back
        }
    }
