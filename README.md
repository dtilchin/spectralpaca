A very serious and complete game.

Built in Unity, utilizing the PicaVoxel plugin (handling lighting models, etc), with models in MagicaVoxel. Just a re-wet-my-feet novelty/learning/art project, since last time I made a 3D game it, it was 20 years ago and it was all C++ making raw OpenGL API calls (`glTranslate3f` for life). The dream for the environment to be composed of voxels, which can be moved/created/destroyed/changed with your magickal alpaca power. Unsurprisingly, it turns out that a naive approach to rendering zillions of cubes with a lighting model that includes translucency does not perform well at all at scale...
